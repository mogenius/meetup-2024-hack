# SmartWash Ltd. - Incident in the making
## The Tale of DevOps-Joe & Developer-Steve
### Developer Steve
Developer Steve is a full-stack developer at SmartWash Ltd. a small company that sells washing machines. He is always drowning in tasks and emergencies. The Development department is chronicly understaffed. One morning, his boss asked him to set up a file-sharing platform to send a 500mb user manuals to a customer. The boss had found some great container-images on Docker Hub and assured Steve it would be easy for a pro like him.

Feeling overwhelmed and frustrated, especially since it was a Friday and he wanted to leave early, Steve decided to tackle the task. The Docker Hub description indicated that he needed to spawn a pod and create a secret for encryption. He needs help from DevOps Joe, as their cluster was highly secure. Steve hoped Joe could quickly create a service account so he could test some images and complete the task.

By the afternoon, Steve had the platform running and informed his boss that it is done. Although he knows that he has a couple of open tasks with it he decided to call it a day.

### DevOps Joe
Joe, the DevOps engineer, felt his head spinning because everyone needed something from him. His employer was trying to hire more people, but no one wants to join SmartWash Ltd..

His friend, Developer Steve, is sharp and always on top of things. Joe trusts Steve because he is competent and reliable. Joe and Steve have worked together for a long time and have a good relationship.

One day, Steve was testing something for their boss and asked Joe to create a service account so he could quickly spawn a pod and create and access a secret. Joe had no problem with this request since Steve knew his stuff. He set up the account and informed Steve that the service account name was "developer-steve." Joe was already planning to delete it in a few days to avoid any issues. However, he wasn't worried because Steve could only spawn pods and get or create secrets, and Joe considered Steve the most capable person in the company. Would could go wrong?  

# Epilogue
As you might guess, the following week, everyone is talking about AI shit, and both Joe and Steve forget to clean up their test environments.
Fast forward six months: the entire system is compromised.
